Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer



using System;
using System.Linq;

public class Kata
{
public static int SquareDigits(int n) => Int32.Parse(string.Join("", n.ToString().Select(x => (x-'0') * (x-'0')).ToArray()));
}
